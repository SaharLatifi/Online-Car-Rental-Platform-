# Online-Car-Rental-Platform
Course-end Project 2

DESCRIPTION
Build an online car rental platform using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

Problem Statement:
A car rental company has requested you to build an online car rental platform where customers should be able to view the available cars that can be rented on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. The company can display the available inventory and confirm requests by checking the available stock. Customers will receive an auto-generated bill when they return the car.

This is a simplified online car rental platform. Customers will be able to:
1.	View a list of all cars 
2.	View a list of all available cars
3.	Choose the rental basis (Which could be hourly, daily and weekly-basis)
4.	Choose the brand, model and number of cars to rent
5.	Return a car by car_id 
6.	Return all rented cars at once


For simplicity, let’s assume that:
1.	Customers can rent cars from any one of the following options—hourly, daily, or weekly rental
2.	Customers are free to choose any number of cars they want, provided the number of available cars is more than the number of requested cars
3.  The rent price does not differ by brand, year and any other car characteristics
